    <h3 class="h3">BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p class="para"> <b class="bold">Colonel Harland David Sanders</b> <i>(September 9, 1890 â€“ December 16, 1980)</i> was an American businessman,<br> best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken <i>(also known as KFC)</i> and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol.<br> His name and image are still symbols of the company.
       KFC was one of the first <b class="bold">American fast-food</b>  chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business.</p>
